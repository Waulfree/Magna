# Magna

Magna is designed to become a simple programming language with an unique but fast and flexible approach to parsing expressions.
The project in its infancy.

Recomendations for commiters:
- Linux kernel coding style is a preffered coding style;
- C89 is the main language standart used within Magna;
- Avoid using recursions as much as possible;
- Headers will include main .c files if built without -DMAGNA_MODULE.
